# UFO Analysis using JavaScript and HTML

## Overview

The purpose of this challenge was to build upon the existing work completed in the module and add additional search filters, including city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. The initial function was replaced by a new filter object that collected the user input gathered by an event listener. The webpage was styled with HTML and CSS components as well as a .jpg file to make the site more appealing.

## Results

The results of the updated JavaScript functions and HTML/CSS styling came out great. It is very user friendly and easy to use the filters since the event listener used was "change." Whether the user clicks enter or simply enters a value and hits tab to the next field, the results will update.

This is the unfiltered view of the table:

In this example, I filtered the table with "San Diego" as the city and the results instantly changed:

## Summary

### One drawback of the webpage

### Two additional Recommendations for further development

- The first thing I'd suggest to add for development would be instant sorting buttons to the headers of each table column, it can make a quick EDA easy on a site like this

- The second thing I would add would be a "download as .csv" button so that a user could export the filtered results

- A bonus 3rd thing would be a user form to add an entry directly to the website (subject to approval by the administrator)
